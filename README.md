## About Me
   
I am a Measurement and Control Technician working in building automation for more than five years , with a strong background in PLC programming and industrial bus systems (BACnet, Modbus).

Alongside my professional work, I use Java to develop software for system integration, automation tooling and protocol-driven solutions.

My interest lies in reliable, deterministic software close to real hardware, bridging classical automation with embedded-oriented software development.

## Professional Background  

My professional background is in measurement, control and regulation technology (MSR) within building automation systems.

I work with PLC-based control systems, industrial communication buses and automation infrastructure used in operational environments.

My work focuses on stable automation logic, structured control concepts and the integration of field-level systems into higher-level software tools.
